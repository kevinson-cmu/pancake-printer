# Pancake Printer
This project is the creation of the namesake. It uses a longrunner Arduino CNC shield which is a clone of the [Protoneer Arduino CNC Shield Ver 3.00](https://blog.protoneer.co.nz/arduino-cnc-shield/) with GRBL.

## Status
Motors currently move as per the setup detailed by Protoneer. However, batter dispension has not yet been addressed in code.

## Goals
1. Get direct input movement up and running
2. Get direct input dispension running synchronously
3. 3d Printer file translation
